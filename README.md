# JCall

JCall is a plugin for vim.  It allows a user to navigate java code in two ways (inspired by eclipse).

* See from where a method might be called. (Call Hierarchy)
* Jump to a method's definition. 

## Installation

This plugin requires python 2.4+ and support in vim.  You can test your vim by seeing if the following command returns a 1.

    :echo has('python')
